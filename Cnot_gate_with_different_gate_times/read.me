This folder contains CNOT gates created with different durations (1, 10, 100, and 1000 microseconds).
The algorithm was executed for different frequencies in the system, while keeping the min/max control amplitudes constant throughout the execution. 
The minimum number of time slots is 10000, and the maximum number of time slots is 1000000.
